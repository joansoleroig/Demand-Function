The demand Function for a business game

This reposity has been created regarding the modelling of a demand function for a business game. The goal was to make a realistic demand function that shifted with variations on price, quality and delivery rates.
The simple demand function was the first approach.
The variable demand function with marketing was the best attempt to modell the demand function.
Note that to run the variable demand function you must run the good_test.py.
